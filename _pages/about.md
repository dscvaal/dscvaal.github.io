# Safe Generative AI for Scientific Discovery Workshop

## Introduction
Welcome to the Safe Generative AI for Scientific Discovery workshop! The workshop emphasizes on AI safety concerns related to the use of generative models in scientific research. Generative
models, including large language models, vision-language models, and diffusion models, have significantly aided various
aspects of scientific discovery. These aspects encompass experimental design, hypothesis formulation, theoretical reasoning,
and observation organization. However, these models have raised substantial concerns about potential misuse and negative
scientific and social impacts.

Key concerns include:
- Generation of harmful or biased content.
- Vulnerability to adversarial attacks.
- Privacy and security risks.
- Bias and fairness issues in generated content.
- Ethical implications of deploying generative AI.
- Limited robustness in out-of-distribution contexts.
- Overconfidence in the reliability of generated content.

This workshop aims to convene experts from various fields to address these challenges and explore potential solutions. By
emphasizing the development of generative models that positively impact scientific progress, the workshop seeks to foster
collaboration and discussion. It will provide a platform for academics and industry professionals to exchange recent findings
and ideas, thereby enriching the discourse in AI’s role in advancing science.
